# UAV-Human-Identification-System
Developed a multi-modal computer vision model using CNNs with an EfficientNetV2-M backbone to detect humans and human-like figures from RGB and thermal UAV imagery. Optimized and quantized the model for ESP32-C6 deployment, enabling real-time on-device inference for UAV-based autonomous operations.
